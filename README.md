### 5 Main Goals

What value do myself and My Family bring to Earth?

- Give me some donations (Buy DOOZLE TEAL), and I will work towards Five Main Goals:

1. Set up scalable trash collection projects.
2. Set up scalable localized farms.
3. Set up scalable microfinance software.
4. Design and build houses, villages and town of the future.
5. Set up the N Prize, where we offer small to medium cash prizes for people who can solve local problems. This actualizes the Henry Ford principle:

* "I don't know the answer to your question, but I can hire someone who does." *

If my leadership/energy is needed, you can buy some DOOZLECoins.

If not, I will sit under tree and learn The Pogues songs.

Busy learning Opensea and Metamask right now.

### Depay Docs

Hey GLP and friends.

Experimenting with money creation now. Trying to figure out Depay Docs now. 

These are very early experiments. 

The aim is to get a fully working codepen up, that non-tech people can fork, and use to receive ETH locally. 

Will use Depay Widgets and openzeppelin wizard.
