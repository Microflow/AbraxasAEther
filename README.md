### The Giving Block. 48 Minute Roundtable Primer on NFT's

Raise money for each project separately, for extreme transparency and clarity. 

## N-Prize 

For the N-Prize, we'll setup two separate funds: 

##### One for admin-costs (a small amount of money).

##### Two, a larger fund for the N-Prize itself. We will use open source, public accounting.      

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of N-Prize funds will go towards the recipients. None will go to us. How will we pay admin costs?

We will pay minimal admin, development and travel costs with any admin-cost-fund donations. 

Two separate fundraises makes the process as transparent as possible.
