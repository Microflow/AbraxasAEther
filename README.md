### 5 Main Goals to Help Fix Earth

*Provide us some donations (Collect DOOZLE TEAL), and we will work towards **Five Main Goals:***

- #### 1. Set up scalable trash-collection projects. 300TWD per hour to clean Danshui boardwalk.
- #### 2. Set up scalable localized farms.
- #### 3. Set up scalable microfinance software. 
- #### 4. Design and build houses, villages and town of the future.
- #### 5. Set up the N-Prize, where we offer small to medium cash prizes for people who can solve local problems. The N-Prize actualizes the Henry Ford principle:

###### * "I don't know the answer to your question, but I can hire someone who does." *

If our leadership/energy is interesting to you, you can collect some DOOZLECoin TEAL NFTs.

### The Giving Block. 48 Minute Roundtable Primer on NFT's

Raise money for each project separately, for extreme transparency and clarity. 

## N-Prize 

For the N-Prize, we'll setup two separate funds: 

##### One for admin-costs (a small amount of money).

##### Two, a larger fund for the N-Prize itself. We will use open source, public accounting.      

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of N-Prize funds will go towards the recipients. None will go to us. How will we pay admin costs?

We will pay minimal admin, development and travel costs with any admin-cost-fund donations. 

Two separate fundraises makes the process as transparent as possible.

### Depay Docs

Hey GLP and friends.

Experimenting with money creation now. Trying to figure out Depay Docs now. 

These are very early experiments. 

The aim is to get a fully working codepen up, that non-tech people can fork, and use to receive ETH locally. 

Will use Depay Widgets and openzeppelin wizard.
