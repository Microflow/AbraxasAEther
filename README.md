### 5 Main Goals to Fix Earth

- Give me some donations (Buy DOOZLE TEAL), and I will work towards Five Main Goals:

1. Set up scalable trash collection projects.
2. Set up scalable localized farms.
3. Set up scalable microfinance software.
4. Design and build houses, villages and town of the future.
5. Set up the N Prize, where we offer small to medium cash prizes for people who can solve local problems. This actualizes the Henry Ford principle:

* "I don't know the answer to your question, but I can hire someone who does." *

If my leadership/energy is needed, you can colelct some DOOZLECoin NFTs.

Raise money for each project separately, for extreme transparency and clarity. 

### N-Prize 

For the N-Prize, set up two separate funds: 

##### One for admin-costs (a small amount of money).

##### Two, a larger fund for the N-Prize itself. We will use open source, public accounting.      

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of N-Prize funds will go towards the recipients, and * none for us * . We will pay minimal admin, development and travel costs with any admin-cost-fund donations.

### Depay Docs

Hey GLP and friends.

Experimenting with money creation now. Trying to figure out Depay Docs now. 

These are very early experiments. 

The aim is to get a fully working codepen up, that non-tech people can fork, and use to receive ETH locally. 

Will use Depay Widgets and openzeppelin wizard.
