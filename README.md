### Depay Docs

Hey GLP and friends.

Experimenting with money creation now. Trying to figure out Depay Docs now. 

These are very early experiments. 

The aim is to get a fully working codepen up, that non-tech people can fork, and use to receive ETH locally. 

Will use Depay Widgets and openzeppelin wizard.
